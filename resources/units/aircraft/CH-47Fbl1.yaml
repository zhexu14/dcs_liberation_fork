  In 2001, the CH-47F, an upgraded CH-47D, made its maiden flight. The first production model rolled out at Boeing's
  facility in Ridley Park, Pennsylvania, and first flew on 23 October 2006. Upgrades included 4,868-shaft-horsepower
  (3,630 kW) Honeywell engines and airframe with better integrated construction for lower maintenance requirements. 
  The milled construction reduces vibration, as well as inspection and repair needs, and eliminates flexing points to
  increase service life. The CH-47F can fly at speeds of over 175 mph (282 km/h) with a payload of more than
  21,000 lb (9,500 kg). New avionics include a Rockwell Collins Common Avionics Architecture System (CAAS) cockpit,
  and BAE Systems' Digital Advanced Flight Control System (DAFCS). AgustaWestland assembles the CH-47F under license,
  known as the Chinook ICH-47F, for several customers. Boeing delivered 48 CH-47Fs to the U.S. Army through August 2008;
  at that time Boeing announced a $4.8 billion (~$6.67 billion in 2023) contract with the Army for 191 Chinooks.
